# InstaSnap [(link)](http://instasnap-ga.herokuapp.com)


## Approach


## User Stories
#### Core
- As a user, my homepage should show me a post feed.
- As a user, I should be able to create new posts.
- As a user, I should be able to edit or delete (only) my posts.
-As a user, I should be able to upload photos instead of using image URLs.

#### Stretch
- As a user, I should be able to log into my own account.
- As a user, I should be able to follow other users so I can see their posts.
- As a user, I should be able to have followers so I can drown in clout.
- As a user, I should be able to see a list of users who are following me.
- As a user, I should be able to block other users.
